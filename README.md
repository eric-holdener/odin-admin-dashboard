# odin-admin-dashboard

This is a project set out by the Odin Project to recreate the image in the reference folder to the best of our ability. While my final product does not look like an exact replica, I am proud of the strides I have made in CSS and HTML within the context of the course so far.

Some things that I should pay attention to in future tasks:
- Media queries for responsiveness for smaller devices (not within the scope of this project)
- Better styling overall (my eye for styling still hasn't fully developed, as well as my css ability to style)
- Continue working on grid and flexbox usage (Having just been introduced to grid, I feel like this project started giving me a good feeling for its capabilities. I still have a ways to go though to properly utilize all of its abilities and make beautiful, responsive websites).
- Learn how to integrate JS into my CSS (one issue I ran into was wanting to resize a p element to fit the container it was in dynamically, specifically with the "site title" dashboard. When googling the answer, I found it was either a case of media queries or using JS to dynamically do math to set the text size. Currently, using JS is outside the scope of my knowledge, but I will get there. I can definitely see where hooking in JS will help in the long run).

The CSS and HTML projects presented by the Odin Project so far have been a good way of flexing my brain and reinforcing the lessons presented before me, and I have been treating them as exercises such as that - not quite worrying about being perfect. Once I finally get to the point of my journey where I am ready to create a personal portfolio website, that is when I will agonize over details and responsiveness.
